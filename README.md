# myApp
### TODO's

a) Each student must install Node.js on the previously installed virtual machine and create a project (myApp) associated with the creation of the server. When submitting the answer to the assignment, they must present the npm init code when it is executed, submitting a print screen (image of the screen).

b) In the same virtual machine, install the Express application and configure it based on the Node.js configuration you've already done. 

c) By using the Express framework, we now have a routing layer for managing a particular request that arrives at the server. Present the concepts found in the articles and texts provided on the Express framework, and write your thoughts on the concepts of routes and how they work on no more than one A4 sheet of paper. You can use graphical elements in your answer. 

NOTE: your reflection must be based on theoretical foundations, which you must refer to (the book and/or articles); you must not rely solely on an unsubstantiated opinion that comes to mind.

d) You must contribute to the debate in general by commenting and giving your opinion (in a sustained manner, as in the previous points) on your colleagues' interventions, and by supporting your colleagues in resolving their doubts, using the task forum for this purpose.
